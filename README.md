# ASRT API

## Setting up the backend API

- If running a linux based system: 
    - create a .env file with the variables from the .env.example file
    - `source` that file into the terminal's environment where the api is to be run from
- Else if running a windows based system:
    - `set` the variables in the .env.example file from within a windows command_line interface
